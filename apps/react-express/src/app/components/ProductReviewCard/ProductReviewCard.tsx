1) It mixes content from a 100 different subscriptions services. So I see content that is on Hulu or HBO even if I am not subscribed to them. It's actually hard to find things that are just available on Prime for free now.
2) The IMDB video is annoying. I don't want to watch ads but Amazon wants me to watch ads. So IMDB video is filling up my feed when I'm not interested in it.
3) Amazon moved quite a few things out of Prime Video which was free and stuck it into IMDB so I have to watch ads. This made the Amazon Prime subscription less valuable.
